    <div style="width: 1200px;">
        <p>Professional monster hunter with over a hundred years of experience dealing with creatures most people have nightmares about. Trained at Kaer Morhen by the School of the Wolf - survived the mutations, learned to swing a sword, and somehow didn't die in the process. I hunt monsters, brew potions, and occasionally get dragged into political messes I'd rather avoid. My work takes me across the Northern Kingdoms, from waterlogged villages with drowner problems to noble courts with considerably worse pest issues. I don't do small talk, I don't work for free, and I especially don't appreciate being called a "freak" - though it happens anyway. Pay me properly, point me toward the monster, and <a href="education-qualifications.html#qualifications">I'll get the job done</a>. No guarantees about cleaning up nicely afterward or attending your victory feast. References available upon request, assuming they're still alive.</p>
